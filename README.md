# Principal Component Analysis
I've had several attempts at learning Principal Component Analysis over the past 1-2 years or so and yet I never quite understand how it really works under the hood.
Like, I'm familiar with what it's capable of, namely dimensionality reduction. I also have a rough idea of how things work. Projecting the data onto a line that captures the most variance, computing the covariance matrix, doing the eigen-stuff, and all that. But I never really appreciate how different parts comes together.

I'm tired of reading about bits of PCA here and there over and over again and never truly understanding the subject. This time once and for all I'm going to clear up all the questions I have about how it works by -- you guessed it -- implementing it from scratch.
